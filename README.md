This modified script detects when you run out of haste stacks and does stacking and restarts the adventure at that point.

Usage:

Changed GUI settings:

"Use dynamic reset zone?" Enables this mod. Disable to have 100% original unmodded functionality. No need to restore backup files.

"Reset after stacking if haste stacks is less than this" for early stacking. Ignored if dynamic reset zone is unchecked.

"Farm after this zone" set to 2000, if you want to stack when Briv runs out of haste stacks.

Settings file "ResetZoneBuffer" is ignored.
